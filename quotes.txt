Human life must be some kind of mistake. The truth of this will be sufficiently
obvious if we only remember that man is a compound of needs and necessities
hard to satisfy; and that even when they are satisfied, all he obtains is a
state of painlessness, where nothing remains to him but abandonment to boredom.
This is direct proof that existence has no real value in itself; for what is
boredom but the feeling of the emptiness of life? If life—the craving for which
is the very essence of our being—were possessed of any positive intrinsic
value, there would be no such thing as boredom at all: mere existence would
satisfy us in itself, and we should want for nothing.
    -- Arthur Schopenhauer

“It works like a dream. It’s a way to hold attention, and it’s awfully good at
that. For a lot of people, TV is life itself.
Churches used to provide people with better company than they had at home, but
now, no matter what your neighbourhood life or family life is like, you turn on
the television, and you get relatives, family.
I don’t know if you’ve heard about this, but scientists have created baby geese
that believe that an aeroplane is their mother.
Human beings will believe in all kinds of things that aren’t true, and that’s
okay. And TV is a part of that.”

If you have six weeks to get a project done, the only thing you control is your

You can’t control others’ expectations.

You can tell them what you know about the project so their expectations have a
chance of matching reality. My terror of deadlines vanished when I learned this
lesson.

It’s not my job to “manage” someone else’s expectations. It’s their job to
manage their own expectations.
